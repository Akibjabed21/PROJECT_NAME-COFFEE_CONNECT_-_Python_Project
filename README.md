## Problem Statement:

    CoffeeConnect is a rapidly growing café chain that specializes in premium coffee offerings
    across urban centers in India. The company has installed a modern POS (Point-of-Sale) system

    ● staffing shifts, 
    ● and potential city-wise expansion, 
    CoffeeConnect has asked you, a Data Analyst Intern, to analyze two months of transaction-level 
    data collected across their outlets. 
    Here it has been given two CSV files: 
          1. index_1.csv – Transactions from February 
          2. index_2.csv – Transactions from March


**Data Dictionary:**

  **Datetime** -  Exact timestamp of the transaction

  **coffee_name** - Name of the coffee purchased

  **Cash_type** - Payment method (cash/card/UPI)
